Exercise 1: Create a class called employee with the following data members
1.	empName
2.	empId
3.	empAge
4.	empdesgn
5.	empLocation
6.	empExpInYrs

All these data members should be initialized using constructors. Use constructor overloading 
and demonstrate by creating different employee objects with

1.	Employee  name alone
2.	Employee name and id
3.	Employee name, id and age
4.	Employee name, id and designation
5.	Employee name, id, age and designation
6.	Employee name, id, age and location
7.	Employee name, id, age and experience
8.	 Employee name, id, designation and experience
9.	Employee name, id, designation, location and experience
10.	Employee name, id, age, designation,  location and experience

Exercise 2:Create a class called Shape3D with the following method signatures volume () and surfaceArea (). Then create subclasses like Cylinder, Sphere, and Cube etc and implement these methods.


Exercise 3:Create a class called shape with the following methods
1.	area
2.	perimeter

                    Overload the area and perimeter method to calculate for both square and rectangle.
                    Create a main class and invoke the area method to calculate the area of the square and rectangle. Also invoke the perimeter method to calculate the perimeter of the square 
and rectangle.
